About us
We have tried Tinder and we love it. We also love to rethink business models. At the same time, we are passionate Tutors. One day, we decided to combine both them and think differently for the tutoring industry.  

My Tutor Jungle's objective is to sell the tutoring experience in a convenient, unique and honest way such that parents will have a complete understanding of what matters most to them.

We think these are what matter most to parents:
- Commitment period of Tutors
- The specific personalities of the students that the tutors have taught before
- Endorsement by ex-students or parents
- And of course, to negotiate for an affordable tuition rate by using commitment period

Oh, did we mention that our aim is to create a win-win situation? 

Don't hesitate, try us today!
